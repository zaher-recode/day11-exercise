# Exercise 40
# You will write a method, find_peaks(array), that accepts an array of integers
# The method should return an array containing all of "peaks" of the array.
# An element is considered a "peak" if it is greater than both it's left and right neighbour.
# The first or last element of the array is considered a "peak" if it is greater than it's one neighbour

# Write Your method code here
def find_peaks(array)
    i = 0
    peaks = Array.new
    while i < array.length
        if i == 0
            peaks << array[i] if array[i]> array[i+1]
        elsif i == array.length - 1
            peaks << array[i] if array[i]> array[i-1]
        else
            peaks << array[i] if (array[i]> array[i-1] && array[i]> array[i+1])
        end
        i += 1
    end
    return peaks
end
